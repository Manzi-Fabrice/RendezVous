# RendezVous WebApp

This directory contains the web application component of the **RendezVous** project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this web application is to make API calls to the backend to fetch event details. This allows the invitee (date) to see the event details and either accept or reject the invitationâ€”without needing to use the mobile app.
